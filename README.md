# dotenv Integration
Github does not let you upload .env files. This means you will have to create your own.
This bot requires a .env file to store your token. You need to make sure that you install the dotenv library. Then you will need to create a .env file in the root directory as your PyBot. 
In this file you will need to write - TOKEN = "your bot token"
